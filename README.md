        if path_test != None:
            assert np.all(np.logical_and(y_true_test >= 0, y_true_test < self.n_classes))
        ```
    * In file "spear/labeling/analysis/core.py" change line 335 or 336 just find similar line and replace to:
        ```
        confusion_matrix(Y, self.L[:, i], labels=labels)[1:, 1:] for i in range(m)
        ```
